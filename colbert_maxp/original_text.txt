 A fence adjustment system comprising a housing a drift adjustment mechanism coupled to the housing and configured to displace a portion of a fence away from the housing the fence being attached to the housing such that displacement of the portion of the fence by the drift adjustment mechanism causes the fence to rotate about a fulcrum a lock movable between a locked configuration and an unlocked configuration wherein the lock limits displacement of the fence relative to the housing when the lock is in a locked configuration and a biasing element arranged to cause the fence to maintain contact with the housing when the lock is in an unlocked configuration a housing a drift adjustment mechanism coupled to the housing and configured to displace a portion of a fence away from the housing the fence being attached to the housing such that displacement of the portion of the fence by the drift adjustment mechanism causes the fence to rotate about a fulcrum a lock movable between a locked configuration and an unlocked configuration wherein the lock limits displacement of the fence relative to the housing when the lock is in a locked configuration and a biasing element arranged to cause the fence to maintain contact with the housing when the lock is in an unlocked configuration The fence adjustment system of claim wherein the fulcrum is disposed on the housing on a side adjacent to the fence The fence adjustment system of claim further comprising a slide block on the housing wherein the fulcrum is defined by the slide block The fence adjustment system of claim wherein the lock includes a threaded shaft and a knob and the biasing element is a coil spring disposed on the shaft and abutting the knob The fence adjustment system of claim wherein the shaft extends through a hole in the housing to engage the fence The fence adjustment system of claim wherein the coil spring is disposed between the housing and the knob to push the knob away from the housing and adapted to draw the fence toward the housing The fence adjustment system of claim wherein the biasing element is associated with the lock The fence adjustment system of claim wherein the drift adjustment mechanism includes a rotating cam The fence adjustment system of claim wherein biasing element is at least one of a coil spring a leaf spring a wave spring a gas spring an elastic rod and an elastic band The fence adjustment system of claim wherein the lock is at least one of a screw interface and a latch The fence adjustment system of claim wherein the drift adjustment mechanism is a tool free drift adjustment mechanism The fence adjustment system of claim wherein the lock comprises a tool free lock The fence adjustment system of claim in combination with the fence A fence adjustment system comprising a housing having a fulcrum the housing configured to engage a first portion of a fence at the fulcrum a cam configured to displace a second portion of the fence wherein displacement of the second portion of the fence by the cam causes the fence to rotate about a fulcrum and a lock movable between a locked configuration and an unlocked configuration wherein the lock limits displacement of the fence when the lock is in a locked configuration wherein in a direction from an infeed side of the fence to the outfeed side of the fence the fulcrum is positioned on the housing followed by the lock positioned in the housing followed by the cam positioned in the housing a housing having a fulcrum the housing configured to engage a first portion of a fence at the fulcrum a cam configured to displace a second portion of the fence wherein displacement of the second portion of the fence by the cam causes the fence to rotate about a fulcrum and a lock movable between a locked configuration and an unlocked configuration wherein the lock limits displacement of the fence when the lock is in a locked configuration wherein in a direction from an infeed side of the fence to the outfeed side of the fence the fulcrum is positioned on the housing followed by the lock positioned in the housing followed by the cam positioned in the housing The fence adjustment system of claim further comprising a biasing element arranged to maintain contact between the fence and housing when the lock is in an unlocked configuration The fence adjustment system of claim wherein the lock includes a threaded shaft and a knob and the biasing element is a coil spring disposed on the shaft and abutting the knob The fence adjustment system of claim wherein the shaft extends through a hole in the housing to engage the fence the fence adjustment system of claim wherein the coil spring is disposed between the housing and the knob to push the knob away from the housing and adapted to draw the fence toward the housing The fence adjustment system of claim wherein the biasing element is associated with the lock The fence adjustment system of claim wherein biasing element is at least one of a coil spring a leaf spring a wave spring a gas spring an elastic rod and an elastic band The fence adjustment system of claim wherein the lock is at least one of a screw interface and a latch The fence adjustment system of claim wherein the fulcrum is disposed on the housing on a side adjacent to the fence The fence adjustment system of claim further comprising a slide block on the housing wherein the fulcrum is defined by the slide block The fence adjustment system of claim further comprising the fence
